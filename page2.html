                     <p>KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Col Robert Netshiunda said the constable got out of the vehicle and shot the tow truck driver.<br><br> “When his colleague intervened, the constable reportedly shot him and another community member. The constable then reportedly turned the gun on himself.”</p>
                     <br><p>The constable and the tow truck driver were declared dead at the scene, while the sergeant and the other man were rushed to hospital. The third police officer survived the shooting.
                        The motive for the shooting is unknown. Police are investigating cases of murder, attempted murder, inquest and reckless and negligent driving.</p>

                        <p>Hazel Ntuli, a University of Pretoria student, has obtained a degree in actuarial science at the age of 17.</p><br>
                        <p>Originally from Rosettenville in Johannesburg, Ntuli began her university studies in 2022, placing her years ahead of her peers. She is the first in her family to graduate from university.</p>
                        <p>“My parents will have their much-deserved bragging rights,” she said. “It will alleviate a lot of pressure and burdens that my family has been carrying for so long.”</p><br>
                        <p>She said her academic talents were recognised when she was in primary school. “When I was in grade 3, I mistakenly wrote a grade 4 mathematics paper and scored the highest of all the actual grade 4 students. My teacher identified this and allowed me to write more grade 4 papers and saw that I performed exceptionally well.”<br> She mentioned that being a bit younger than her classmates had its own challenges, but with the support of mentors, lecturers and friends, she thrived.</p>

                <div class="column">
                    <p>“Many students treated me like the little sister they never had. There were a lot of expectations of me, and it got difficult to meet those expectations.</p>
                    <p>I always reminded myself of why I’d started and made sure that my ‘why’ was strong enough. Having multiple vision boards kept me on track and, of course, prayer.”</p><br>
                    <p>Ntuli is pursuing her honours degree and plans to qualify as an actuary and enter the business world in the future.</p>
                    <p>“After this, I’m planning to both work and further my studies. I’ve always wanted an MBA.”</p>
                    <br><p>She advised young people to have a teachable spirit to succeed. “You don’t know everything. Learn how to fail forward. Take your losses, mix them up with perseverance and grit. Be like a baby when taking on a challenge — ready to receive all the knowledge and wisdom you can.”</p><br> 
                    <p>Higher education and training minister Nobuhle Nkabane congratulated Ntuli on her achievement and urged young people to draw inspiration from her.</p>
                    <br><p>“This extraordinary milestone makes Ntuli one of the youngest graduates in the university's history, and a shining example of academic excellence, resilience and the transformative power of education,” Nkabane said.</p>
                    <br><p>“She is not only breaking boundaries in the academic space; she is breaking intergenerational barriers, becoming the first graduate in her family and lighting the way for others.”</p>
